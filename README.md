# Code Quiz

Test your coding knowledge with this simple coding quiz. 

Your score is kept using a timer - each incorrect answer will deduct seconds from your total time. When you run out of time, or when you answer all of the questions, the game is over. 

## Languages Used

JavaScript, CSS, HTML

## Further Development Goals

In the future I would like to add additional styling to this project, as well as more questions and a different scoring system.
